    "# Introduction to data science - Assignment #3\n",
    "The ‘crime.csv’, ‘kidney disease.csv’, and ‘email.csv’ data files attached to the assignment file (available at Sakai) is taken from the UCI repository [1] and Kaggle website [2, 3]. The Crime Data file reports the number of violent crimes per 100,000 population for the communities within the United States. It also includes some socio-economic factors. The variables are as follows:\n",
    "* ‘PctPopUnderPov’: Percentage of people under the poverty level (numeric: from 0 to 1)\n",
    "* ‘PctUnemployed’: Percentage of unemployed people (numeric: from 0 to 1)\n",
    "* ‘PolicPerPop’: Ratio of police officers to the population (numeric: from 0 to 1)\n",
    "* ‘Pcthomeless’: Percentage of homeless people (numeric: from 0 to 1)\n",
    "* ‘PctBSorMore’: Percentage of people with a bachelor’s degree or higher education (numeric: from 0 to 1)\n",
    "* ‘ViolentCrimesPerPop’: Ratio of violent crimes to the population (numeric: from 0 to 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kidney Disease Data reports the age, blood pressure, and the results of the blood test factors for healthy people and kidney patients. This data includes the following 9 variables:\n",
    "* ‘age’: Age of the individual (numeric: from 2 to 90)\n",
    "* ‘bp’: Blood pressure (numeric: from 50 to 180)\n",
    "* ‘sod’: Blood sodium level test result (numeric: from 104 to 163)\n",
    "* ‘pot’: Blood potassium level test result (numeric: from 2.5 to 47)\n",
    "* ‘hemo’: Hemoglobin blood test result (numeric: from 3.1 to 17.8)\n",
    "* ‘pcv’: Packed cell volume test result (numeric: from 9 to 54)\n",
    "* ‘wc’: White blood cell test result (numeric: from 2200 to 26400)\n",
    "* ‘rc’: Red blood cell test result (numeric: from 2.1 to 8)\n",
    "* ‘CKD’: Chronic kidney disease (binary: 0 for healthy individuals and 1 for kidney patients)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Email Data includes the text of the numerous emails labeled as spam or not spam. This data includes the following columns:\n",
    "* ‘email’: Text of the email (string)\n",
    "* ‘label’: Label of the email (binary: 1 for spam and 0 for not-spam)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note.** You must put the CSV files in the same folder as your code file. If you use Jupyter notebook it should be in the address: ‘C:/Users/YOURUSER-NAME’. You can also read the file by its address; for example:\n",
